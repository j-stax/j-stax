## Hi, welcome to my GitHub page!👋

👨‍💻 I'm a full stack developer looking for my first breakout role in the tech industry.

📚 Over the past year, I have continued to develop my skills through project-based learning from several quality sources such as, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home), [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/), and [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp).

💻 Some of my notable projects are [Bandsite](./james-ahn-bandsite), [Static Site Generator](./static-site-generator), 
and [Music Library](./music-library-with-auth).

🌐 I encourage you to visit my [developer page](https://www.jamesahn.dev/) to learn more about me and the projects I've worked on.
